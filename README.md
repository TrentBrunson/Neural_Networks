###### 
Alphabet Soup requests model that will predict the success of a venture based on data they provided from past ventures.  A binary claification model will be used to predict future results.

### Analysis

###### 
I started with a 2-layer deep learning model to evaluate the dataset; this was activate with a relu function.  this returned 
How many neurons and layers did you select for your neural network model? Why?
Were you able to achieve the target model performance? What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
If you were to implement a different model to solve this classification problem, which would you choose? Why?
