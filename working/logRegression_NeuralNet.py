# With a logistic regression model, there is no preprocessing or scaling required for the data. 
# However, a basic neural network needs the numerical variables standardized. 
# Therefore, need to keep track of a scaled and unscaled training dataset 
# such that both models have the correct input data in their preferred formats.
